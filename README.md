# SLIM-for-Top-N-Recommender-System 
We have implemented a SLIM method for Top-N Recommendation in python with different machine learning libraries. SLIM a linear regression model is a new version of Matrix Factorization approach which produces a better result in compare to other state of art methods . We implemented and trained a Recommendation engine with two learning algorithms i.e Stochastic gradient descent algorithm and Coordinate descent algorithm.
